Server.ja

1. **Require the 'http' module:**

   This line imports the built-in `http` module in Node.js, which provides functionality for creating HTTP servers and clients.
2. **Create an HTTP server:**

   The `createServer` method is used to create an HTTP server. It takes a callback function that will be invoked whenever a request is made to the server. In this example, the callback function takes two arguments: `req` (the request object) and `res` (the response object).

   * `res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });`: This line sets the HTTP status code to 200 (OK) and specifies the content type as plain text. The `writeHead` method is used to write the response headers.
   * `res.end('Hello, World!\n');`: This line sends the actual response body, in this case, the string "Hello, World!\n". The `end` method is used to end the response, and anything passed to it will be sent as the response body.
3. **Specify the port and start the server:**

   * `const port = 3000;`: This line specifies the port on which the server will listen for incoming requests. In this case, it's set to port 3000.
   * `server.listen(port, () => { console.log('Server listening at http://localhost:${port}'); });`: This line starts the server to listen on the specified port. The callback function is executed once the server is successfully started, and it logs a message indicating that the server is listening at a specific URL.

   Note: There's a mistake in the original code where the string interpolation inside the `console.log` is not correct. It should use backticks (`) instead of single quotes (') for template literals to work. The corrected line should be:
4. **Run the server:**
   Finally, the server is started by executing the following command in the terminal:

   This will make the server listen for incoming requests on port 3000.
5. **Access the server:**
   You can open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the "Hello, World!" response.
