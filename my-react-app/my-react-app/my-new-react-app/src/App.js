/* 
The difference between the two code snippets lies in the implementation of the components:

CounterClass.js:

This component is implemented as a class component.
It utilizes the Component class from React.
State is managed using a constructor function and setState method.
The state variable count is initialized in the constructor.
There are separate methods (increment and decrement) to handle state updates.
The state is accessed using this.state and updated using this.setState.
This component follows the class component lifecycle methods such as constructor and render.


CounterFunction.js:

This component is implemented as a functional component using React hooks (useState).
It utilizes the useState hook to manage state.
State is initialized using the useState hook with a default value of 0.
There are two functions (increment and decrement) defined using arrow functions to update the state.
The state is accessed directly as count and updated using the setCount function returned by useState.
This component utilizes the latest React feature of hooks, allowing functional components to manage state and other React features without needing class components. /*
